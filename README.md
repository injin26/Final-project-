# Final-project-
Hello! My name is Inji Novruzlu, and for my project with NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, I made a Traffic Sign Recognition System. The main purpose of this is to help the drivers understand when they should stop, be cautious, and go, which can ultimately help reduce the number of car accidents. By scanning a traffic light, the recognizer will share what the colour means for the driver.
